<p>Hello! my name is Cory, I'm (currently) a web developer residing in Austin, Texas.
My professional interests include game development, dev ops, web development, data mining and AI. </p>

<p>
I decided to start a blog to serve both as a central location for you to find all of my projects, and as an avenue for networking with other people with similar interests.  Who knows? Maybe together we can make something really cool! <p>So don't hesitate to <a href="/contact">reach out</a>.</p>
