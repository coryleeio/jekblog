	Hello! my name is Cory, I'm a web developer residing in Austin, Texas.
	My professional interests include game development, dev ops, web development, data mining and AI.

<p>
	I decided to start a blog to serve both as a central location for all of my projects, as well as an avenue for networking with other people with similar interests.
